<abstract>The raster calculates the count of all deduplicated low-center IWPs with their centroid falling within 1km resolution. (If the IWPs is overlaid by the 1km pixel BBOX, but their centroids falling outside, they won't be count in this pixel). </abstract>
<purpose>This raster stores the total number of low-center IWPs in Alaska. Each pixel value shows the count of low-center IWPs within the 1km*1km area.</purpose>
