</citeinfo>

<descript>
<abstract>The raster calculates the minimum length value among all deduplicated IWPs with their centroid falling within 1km resolution. (If the IWPs is overlaid by the 1km pixel BBOX, but their centroids falling outside, they won't be count in this pixel). </abstract>
<purpose>This raster stores the minimum length of IWPs in Alaska. Each pixel value shows the minimum length among IWPs within 1km*1km area.</purpose>
