</citeinfo>
</citation>
<descript>
<abstract>The size of one grid is 256km * 256km. The grids were created using Fishnet tool in ArcGIS, starting from bottom left corner (-3,189,757.915768m, -3,189,757.915768m), to upper left corner (3,210,242.084242m, 3,210,242.084242m).To search for all IWPs segmented, we visually inspect the grids which potentially cover IWPs, and slightly broaden the extent to ensure no IWPs are missing. North Bound: 2,698,242.084287 m. South Bound: -1,909,757.915790. East Bound: 3,210,242.084268 m. West Bound: -3,189,757.915768 m. EPSG: 3413.</abstract>
